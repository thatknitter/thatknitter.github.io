#Hello Knitters. [Let's yarn.](/blog.html)

![Me, with really short hair](/images/temple-square-348.jpg =150x200)

You have reached the tech blog of Kimberly Lewis, known online as "thestashattacked," "thatknitter," and occassionally "girl_with_all_the_yarn." If you want to know more about me, keep reading. If you want to see some of the cool stuff I've made, [click here,](../knitting.html) and if you'd like to see the websites I've built, check out [my portfolio.](../portfolio.html)

I like cats. I like yarn. Cats like yarn. Let me tell you about my cats.
			
But first let me tell you about myself. 
			
I'm a web developer and social media manager who hails from Nashville, Tennessee. I'm a transplant here from Colorado, and the lack of snow is very confusing to me. Seriously, where's all the snow?
			
My skills involve:

* Computers

* Knitting

* Confusing people (really, this is not a skill I was trying to develop. It just sort of... happened.)

My tech skills involve:

* HTML

* CSS

* Javascript (I'm serously good at Javascript)

* VIM

* IUX

As you've probably realized, I'm a lot of fun to be around. I'm also kinda nuts. 
			
You can find me on pretty much any social media network, but I'm most easily found on

I also blog in several places. Check me out not only here, but on my other blog and on The Family Learning Tree where I write about all kinds of
things including the Zombie Apocalypse and "Oh Crap" Vegetarians.
