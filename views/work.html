<h1>Things I've Made</h1>

<a href="https://github.com/thatknitter/healthfull_eating">HealthFULL Eating</a>
<p>HealthFull Eating is a site I started work on in 2013. It focuses on educating families on food and the "whys" of nutrition. Instead of saying "eat
  this, because it's good for you, and don't ask questions," it shows you the science of why foods are good or bad for you, from insulin and antioxidants,
  to the fundamental chemistry of fats and vitamins. It starts you cooking healthy, delicious foods that kids will love, and shows you how to transition
  to a healthier lifestyle without causing mutiny in the ranks.</p>
  
<p>I have also written several articles for the site.</p>

<p>Because he is awesome, my stepfather (who I affectionately refer to as "John-Dad") helped me out during my six months at Nashville Software School. 
  He is also an audiologist for most of the northwest corner of Colorado. This is the website I built him.</p>

<a href="http://www.thatknitter.com/NSChess">NSS Chess</a>

<p>This was a group project I worked on with <a href="https://github.com/colbydehart">Colby DeHart</a>, 
  <a href="https://github.com/CharisseL">Charisse Lambert</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/davidgvns">David Givens.</a> We built a chess game for the 
  web. It even has some fan boards because we felt like it.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/thatknitter/knit_designer">Knit Designer and Knit Designer Pro</a>

<p>This is a downloadable application for knitting pattern designers. Because every publisher in the knitting pattern industry thinks they are the "industry 
   standard", they all put out different sizing requirements. This can be confusing and difficult for a new designer, not to mention time consuming.</p>
   
<p>Knit Designer allows the pattern designer to knit one garment, put in the measurements, and it generates a series of sizes and stitch numbers based
  on what publisher the designer chooses. It also generates a blocking diagram and has a charting system for cable and lace patterns.</p>

<a href="http://www.thatknitter.com/bloxBot/#/">BloxBot</a>

<p>BloxBot was a project for Hack Tennessee 7. The idea was that we would build a system to teach kids how to write code and do Computer Aided Design 
  (CAD) using Arduinos and Legos to build robots. Using Lego's free program <a href="">Lego Digital Designer</a> and the open source code for Arduino, we developed a 
  curriculum and tested it while at the 48 hour hackathon.</p>
  
<p>The team consisted of 8 adults and a middle school robotics team.</p>
  
<p>I did surprisingly little programming since I was the project leader. I played the role of project manager/scrum master and spent most of my time 
  ensuring the thousands of parts that needed managing were organized, and instructing kids on how they could help with the robots.</p>
  
<p>The end result was a robot built by the kids called "DalekBot" who went back and forth based on however many seconds had elapsed. We took 6th out of
  24 entries.</p>
  
<p>The site is currently under construction until we completely finish the curriculum and social media. We plan on having several more features in the
  near future.</p>

<p>We have all encountered someone out there who gets a little... offended at things they see on the internet. I made this off an image someone gave
  me just for them.</p>
  
<p>Note: I did this in an hour over my lunch break. It's a tad glitchy, and I don't intend to fix it.</p>
