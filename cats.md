I told you I would tell you about my cats!

![Jazzy](../images/Jazzy.jpg)

Jazzy is my 6-year-old calico/siamese mix. She appears in a great many pictures, and is very popular on my Twitter feed.  
The problem everyone other than me has with her is that she has a split personality. You can never be sure if it's her you're petting, or her evil twin Skippy, and you won't know until she bites you.  

Jazzy likes string. Like, she seriously likes string. Give her some string and a laser pointer and she's a happy cat.

![Tigger](../images/tigger.jpg =500x450)  
Tigger is the Old Man Kitty. He's about 17 (try telling him that). He's also a freaking genius. We got a puppy early in 2014 and there was an incident where he moved a completely full glass 6 inches (!) to the left in order to knock it over onto her kennel. The stories I could tell you about this little booger...  

One night I was alone in the house. It was around Christmas and in small-town Colorado you order everything online. Therefore, there were several boxes on the counter. About 1:30 in the morning, I awake to a THUMP. I grab my shelf (it's a shelf that hasn't been put together yet, so it doubles as a weapon as needed) and run out to the kitchen.  
There, on the counter, is Tigger, looking very pleased with himself. He's peering over the edge of the counter where he's pushed a few boxes onto the ground, and he's going "Heh. That was fun." Then he started on the next box. I yelled at him a bit and he got down off the counter.  
30 minutes later, he's outside my door, yowling up a storm. I go to see if he wants snuggles. He stops, looks at me, and walks away.

This is Sammy the Yarn Thieving Beast. He is a douche. Period.
