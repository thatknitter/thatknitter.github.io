I like cats. I like yarn. Cats like yarn. Let me tell you about my cats.
			
But first let me tell you about myself. 
			
I'm a web developer and social media manager who hails from Nashville, Tennessee. I'm a transplant here from Colorado, and the lack of snow is very confusing to me. Seriously, where's all the snow?
			
My skills involve:
*Computers
*Knitting
*Confusing people

My tech skills involve:
*HTML
*CSS
*Javascript (I'm serously good at Javascript)
*VIM
*IUX

As you've probably realized, I'm a lot of fun to be around. I'm also kinda nuts. 
			
You can find me on pretty much any social media network, but I'm most easily found on
[Facebook](
Twitter
LinkedIn
Tumblr
Reddit
Google+
Ravelry

I also blog in several places. Check me out not only here, but on my other blog and on The Family Learning Tree where I write about all kinds of
things including the Zombie Apocalypse and "Oh Crap" Vegetarians.
