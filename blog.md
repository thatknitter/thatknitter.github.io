##School, Week One, Fairy Tale Style

Once upon a time there was a fairy princess. We will quietly and non-confrontationally ignore the fact that she had no wings and was remarkably lacking in forest creature friends to do her housework for her, which means she probably wasn't a princess at all, but that is by the by. For the purposes of this story, she is a fairy princess. **Quit laughing.**

She decided she wanted to be a programmer and enrolled in a magical place called Nashville Software School. She excitedly began her first week in school, completely under the delusion that she was a fairy princess and therefore invincible.

That was squashed immediately when she discovered that they were going to blast a fire hose's amount of knowledge at her and she would have to figure out how to drink from it. 

This week's proverb: 

#####Welcome to NSS. It's a lot like a hose.
